Html.RenderPartial():

The RenderPartial helper method 


is same as the Partial method except that it returns void and writes resulted html of a specified partial view into a http response stream directly. 

 @{
        Html.RenderPartial("_HeaderNavBar");   
    }

Note : RenderPartial returns void, so a semicolon is required at the end and so it must be enclosed in the braces. 
or
@Html.Partial("_HeaderNavBar")  



@Html.Partial() method doesn't need to be in code block because it returns a html string.
