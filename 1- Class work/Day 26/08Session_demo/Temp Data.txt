TempData is used to transfer data from view to controller, controller to view, or from one action method to another action method of the same or a different controller.

TempData stores the data temporarily and automatically removes it after retrieving a value.

TempData is a property in the ControllerBase class. So, it is available in any controller or view in the ASP.NET MVC application.
