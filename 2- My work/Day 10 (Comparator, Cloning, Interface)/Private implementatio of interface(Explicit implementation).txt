1. It may happen that we implement 2 interface which have the same method signature

2. So when we override and implement the method, we are implementing botht the methods.

3. But surely we created different interface for diff purposes, so we need to figure out the way to give 2
   separate implementations these 2 interfaces.

4.Eg :
	interface IA {

		void disp();
	}

	interface IB {

		void disp();

	}


	//Normal
	class MyClass : IA, IB {

		public void disp() {
			
		}

	}



	//Private implementation 
	class MyClass : IA, IB {
		
		//private methods (So cannot access using Class reference)
		void IA.disp() {

		}

		void IB.disp() {

		}

	}


5. This implemented methods can only be accessed using Interface reference
