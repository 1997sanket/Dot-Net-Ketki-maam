1. In Java we have a 'clone' method in Object class which was protected, so we have to override it and then
   clone. (Cloning done in main method)

2. Here we have 'memberWiseClone' method in Object class, it is also protected, but it is not virtual so we 
   cannot override it.

3. We can either make our own method which we can call and do the cloning inside this method, or we can
   implement 'ICloneable' interface and override its 'Clone' method, inside this method we can use 
   'memberWiseClone'


	One more reason why C# is bullshit
