1. Both are used for releasing resources.

2. Here destructor is same as "finalize()" method of Java. It internally calls "finalize()" method

3. It is called right before object is going to be Garbage collected.

4. That is the problem with Destructor, we cannot predict when it will be called. So the resources it is 
   using will stay for that long.

5. "Dispose()" is a method inside "IDisposable" interface. "DBConnection", "Stream", etc. classes implement 
    this interface and they have overridden this method. Whenever we want to releases resources we just 
    have to call this method. (Same as "obj.close()" method of Java)
