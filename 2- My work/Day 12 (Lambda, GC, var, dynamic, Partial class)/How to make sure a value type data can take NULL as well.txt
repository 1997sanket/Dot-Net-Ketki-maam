1. Value type data like "int, long, etc" cannot be null.

2. But we need that, because it may happen that we are extracting some Object from DB, and one of its 
   properties is null, but since our primitive property of object cannot be null, it may give us error.

3. In java this problem is easily solved by wrapper class, because they can point to null.

4. But in C# wrapper classes are not there, so they have given us a way.
  	
	int ?a = 10; //Now this 'a' can be null as well.
