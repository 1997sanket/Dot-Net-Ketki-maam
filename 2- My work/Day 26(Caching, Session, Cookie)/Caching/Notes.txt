1. Suppose we make a Website like Flipkart.

2. We have various products here for sale. 

3. Suppose user clicks button 1, he gets 10 items, then he clicks button 2,
   he gets another 10 itmes. Now he again clicks 1, now again the server will 
   hit the database and fetch the same 10 records.

4. So, unnecessarily we are hitting the server again and again for the same 
   records. 

5. What if somehow, in the first fetch we could cache that fetch for atleast
   some time, so that in that time, if the user requests again we dont have
   to hit the database again and can just show him the cached records.

6. Shopping site is a good example of using Caching.

7. But sites like Stock markets, Cricket score, where data is constantly 
   changing, we have to get the fresh record.
