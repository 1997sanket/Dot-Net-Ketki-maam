1. Same old concept of session. 

2. It is unique for each user.

3. Remember in Java, how we created a session for the user, and whatever 
   items he put in the shopping cart, we put those items in the arraylist 
   and store that arraylist in the session object and thus we could display
   that arraylist in the checkout page.

4. Session internally uses cookies.
