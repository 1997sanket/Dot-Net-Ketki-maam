1. All primitive datatypes in C# are structure internally. And their parent class is Object.

2. Structure is located on stack. Even if we use 'new' keyword.

3. Structure has default no arg constructor, but we cannot use it. We can use param constructor but we have
   to initialize all the members.

4. Generally structure is used when we want around 16bytes of members inside structure. Because structure is 
   inside stack, acessing it is faster than on heap.
