1. The concept is similar to static block of Java

2. It can be used to initialize static members. Or do some important job at class loading time.

3. Is called when class gets loaded. (So called only once)

4. Doesn't have any access modifiers, because it wont make sense. As it is only going to be called by CLR.

5. One class can have only 1 static constructor.
