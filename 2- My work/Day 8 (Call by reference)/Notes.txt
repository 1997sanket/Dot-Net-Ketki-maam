1. Call by value(java, Cpp, C#) vs address(C, Cpp) vs reference(Cpp, C#)

2. Diff between ref and out keyword

	ref should be initialized before passing, out gets initialized in the method it is passed.

3. Method hiding 
	
	If parent class method is not virtual and we redefine it in child class.

	Parent p = new Child();
	p.show();	//Parent show will be called


4. Method overloading

	If parent class method is virtual and we redefine it using 'override' keyword. 

	Parent p = new Child();
	p.show();	//Child show will be called (Runtime Polymorphism)
