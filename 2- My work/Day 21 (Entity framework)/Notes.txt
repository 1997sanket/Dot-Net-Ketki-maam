1. Entity framework is ORM of .Net.

2. It makes our life so much easier.

3. Here we can design our Database tables in Visual studio and the respective Classes
   and Tables in the database will created.

4. It has very basic CRUD operations and we can even use LinQ with it.

5. We get a Businesss layer class which inherits 'DbContext' class which has 'DbSet' of 
   our table/class.

6. Using this class's object we do our CRUD operations.


7. Suppose we add a new Employee, it first gets added in the set, to do permanent changes in the
   database table we need to use 'saveChanges()' method.

8. Scalar property - Properties which are not foreign key(which do not relate this table with other table/tables). Eg : Name, Salary, etc

9. Navigation property - Properties which are used to relate this table with other table/tables. Eg : DepartmentID as a foregin key in
			 Employee table.

10. Lazy loading 
	By default loading is Lazy. That is when we fetch all the Employees from the database, Department objects are not retrieved.
        They will be retrieved only when we need them, only when w call a certain method/property on a Department object of a particular 
        Employee. This is used mostly.


11. Eager loading
	When we fetch all Employees, their respective Department objects are also retrieved.
