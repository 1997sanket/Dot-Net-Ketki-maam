Object.equals(p1,p2)	-> Safer than non static method


1. It provides provison for null pointer exception i.e if either of the reference passed is null then this
   method will return 'false'
		
		ELSE
			It will call virtual method on each of them and check further.



2. If we directly use virtual equals (Like in JAVA) then there may be a problem of NPE, if either of the 
   reference is null
