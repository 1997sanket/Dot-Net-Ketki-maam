1. Difference in static equals and non static equals method
	static equals internally calls virtual nonstatic method, static equals doesn't throw exception

2. Calling "reference equals()" on 2 primitives with same value. What happens ?

	Internally they get boxed in 2 separate object, so they wont be equal
