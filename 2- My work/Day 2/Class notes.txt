1. byte + byte results in int. So either do type casting or left side should be int.

2. Assembly can be '.exe' file (if it has Main method) or '.dll' file if its just a library that we want to
   use in some applicatio.

3. Assembly is of 3 types 
	a) Local	b) Shared	c)Satellite

a)Local : When we add a '.dll' file in our project. Our project gets copy of that '.dll' file also.


b)Shared : Supppose we have 10k applications and all want to use the same library file, then all will have 
           same copy of the dll file, which is not optimal, so we need to add the library file in something
	   something called as GAC (global assembly cache). So that each project doesnt have the same copy.

c)Satellite : More on this later.


4. checked keyword : Suppose in case we are using byte data type and we think result may overflow(get bigger
                     than 255) then we can either collect the result in int or if we still want to use byte
		     we can use it, but due to overflow our result will go around and become something like
		     0,1,2.... If we want to avoid this than we need to use 'checked' block. Now incase 
		     our range overflows it will give us Runtime exception.

5. Difference between 'int.parse', 'Convert.toInt32()' and 'int.TryParse()'
