1. When we send data to the View, we send an object. It could be Entity object
   itself or Collection of an Entity.

2. But what if we have relationships between different Entities. For eg:
   A Department has many Employees. 

3. Suppose we want to Edit detail of an Employee, so we click Edit link 
   and we get a form filled with that Employee details already. In that form 
   we can also see the Department in which that Employee belongs to.

4. How is the possible ? In the Edit[HttpGet] controller we can only send 
   1 type of object to the View, so how can we send Department object for that
   particular Employee as well ?? 

5. So, the answer is ViewBag. In the Viewbag we can add the department for that
   employee and thus we can access that view bag in the View for the Action.
