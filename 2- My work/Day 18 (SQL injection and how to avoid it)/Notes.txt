1. We use SqlCommand class to execute a query.

2. If it is a select query we get results in 'SqlDataReader' and command we execute is 'ExecuteQuery()'

3. If it is a insert, update, delete query we need to use command 'ExecuteNonQuery()'

4. If our query is going to return result of some aggregate SQL function we use 'ExecuteScalar()'



5. SQL injection is when we write data from user and add that data directly in our query. 
	This is very bad, as user may enter a delete statement and all the records of our table will be deleted.

6. Solution :
	a) Paramterized query
	b) Stored procedure.
