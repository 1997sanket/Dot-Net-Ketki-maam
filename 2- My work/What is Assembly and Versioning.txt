1. Assembly is nothing but the project we make. We either make console project(.exe) file or Class library
   project (So other programs can use our dll to use our classes)

2. Versioning :

	a) Suppose we download and install a game. We get .dll files with the game. But when we update the
	   game, we get another .dll file along with it. If versioning didn't exist, our new DLL file would
	   replace the old one. But what if we want to use the old one as well, this is where versioning
	   comes into picture. Because of versioning we get a different DLL file with different version number
	   and our existing dll file still exists with older version number.


	b) Simple relatable example would be suppos we make a DLL having MyClass with sqr() method and give
	   to the client. After someday I edit this class and add a method cube() as well, and now give this 
	   new DLL to the client. So because of versioning client can have 2 DLL files and he can use 
	   whatever he wants.
