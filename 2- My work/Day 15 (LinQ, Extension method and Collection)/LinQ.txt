1. Short for Language integrated query.

2. It is query language which can be used on any Data source like Collections, Array, Database, XML.

3. Syntax is similar to SQL. Eg:

	var result = from x in mylist where x.Name.Contains("v") select x; 

4. This is just the query. It is not fired yet.

	var resultX = result.ToList();	//This will actually fire and get result

5. This is called as Deferred Execution.


6. We can also use Extension Methods instead of using the query. For eg above example can be written in 
   methods like

	var result = mylist.Where(x=>x.Contains("v").Select(x=> x);

	var resultX = mylist.ToList();
