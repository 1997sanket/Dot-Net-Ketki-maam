1. Suppose we developed a class Employee and many other classes and made our application. 

2. Now we want to add some additional functionality in our Employee class.

3. If we add in the existing employee class, it may break our application.

4. One thing we can do is extend this class and then add our new functionality. But then we have to maintain
   2 Employee classes now. But here is the catch, what if our Employee class needs to be final/sealed ? 

5. So this is where extension method comes into picture.

6. Now we have String class which is final. And for our application there is some functionality which 
   we needs to apply on String references a lot. So we will make an extention method.

7. Steps to make extension method

	a) Create static class 
	b) create static method
	c) add "this" in parameter


8. Eg:

	public static class Employee_Extension {

		public static String ChangeFirstLetterToUpper(this String str) {

			//logic

		}

	}


	Main() {

		String str1 = "hello";

		String str2 = str.ChangeFirstLetterToUpper();	//returns "Hello"

	}
