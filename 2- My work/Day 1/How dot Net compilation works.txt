1. Source code is compiled to MSIL by C sharp compiler and MSIL file is compiled to native code by 
   JIT compiler.

2. When we run our application, a dll file called 'msscoree.dll' also get embedded in our Assembly(project)
   and its '_CoreExeMain()' function is added in our project.

3. OS cannot directly communicate with CLR, so it calls '_CoreExeMain()' function, which in turns wakes up 
   CLR, and then CLR loads classes on demand basis and are compiled by JIT compiler.

4. CLR only deals with Managed code and not Unmanaged code(where pointers are used).
